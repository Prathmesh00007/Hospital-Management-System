# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A full-stack, web-based platform to streamline the core operations of a healthcare facility—from patient intake and staff management to appointment scheduling and record-keeping. Designed with extensibility and maintainability in mind, this system uses a clean separation of frontend and backend components, follows industry best practices, and can be deployed on any modern cloud or on-premises infrastructure.

## 🌟 Overview

Modern hospitals need an integrated system to manage everything from patient records to staff schedules. This project provides:

- A **RESTful API** to manage patients, doctors, and appointments  
- A **responsive SPA** (Single-Page Application) for administrative staff  
- Clear separation of concerns: frontend vs. backend  
- An extensible codebase ready to plug in authentication, analytics, and external integrations  

---

## ✅ Key Features

- **Patient Module**  
  - Register new patients, update demographics, discharge records  
- **Staff Module**  
  - Add/edit doctor and nurse profiles, department assignments  
- **Appointment Scheduler**  
  - Book, reschedule, or cancel appointments with real-time availability checks  
- **Dashboard & Reporting**  
  - View daily appointment load, patient demographics, occupancy rates  
- **Role-Based Access (future)**  
  - Placeholder for integrating JWT/OAuth2 workflows for secure access

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+  
- npm v6+ or Yarn v1+  
- (Optional) A running database instance (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prathmesh00007/Hospital-Management-System.git
   cd Hospital-Management-System
Backend setup

bash
cd backend
npm install
Frontend setup

bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend/ folder and define:

dotenv
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
# DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hospital
# JWT_SECRET=yourStrong(!)SecretKey
Uncomment and configure DB_URI and JWT_SECRET if you integrate a database and authentication.

Running the App
In two separate shells:

bash
# 1) Start backend server
cd backend
npm start
# ⇒ Listening on http://localhost:4000

# 2) Serve frontend (hot-reload)
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
# ⇒ Opens http://localhost:3000
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the admin dashboard.
